When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When working with more than one computer...
    When working with other people...
    When wishing to share a project...
    When wishing to have an additional backup...

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Once again, I'd rather keep the control of the moment and about the content I expect to share...
    Additionnaly, as I made a typo and as it was suggested to push the answer,
    I complete the explanation with the commands I've run :
    - git add lesson*
    - git commit -m "Completed some answer and as the content can be seen by anyone on the Web, added some warning on possible wrong answers..."
    - git push origin master

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches and forks coulmd be considered and identical excepted that :
    - branch is related to the local computer
    - fork is related to the remote servers.
    Clone is aimed to get on a local computer (new directory) a copy of an existing repository.
    The repository to copy may be either remote or local.
    Reminder : - git help clone 
               - git clone <url>
               - git clone -l <path>

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
